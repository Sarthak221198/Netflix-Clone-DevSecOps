## 🔹 DevOps Section
### **Step 1 — Launch AWS Infrastructure**
- Launch an **Ubuntu 22.04 T2 Large**  with an elastic IP associated with the VM (to have an same public IP incase of mutiple restarts)

### **Step 2 — Installtion of Jenkins, docker and trivy **

**Jenkins**
 is an open-source automation server used for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). It automates the build, test, and deployment process of software development and integrates with various tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and Trivy.

```sh
vi jenkins.sh

#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
#sudo apt upgrade -y
wget -O - https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public | tee /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc] https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/deb $(awk -F= '/^VERSION_CODENAME/{print$2}' /etc/os-release) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/adoptium.list
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install temurin-17-jdk -y
/usr/bin/java --version
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
                  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
                  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
                              /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins

sudo chmod 777 jenkins.sh
./jenkins.sh    # this will installl jenkins

```

- After installing Jenkins, update your AWS EC2 Security Group to allow inbound traffic on port 8080, as      Jenkins operates on this port.
- Access the application by entering your EC2 Public IP Address followed by port 8080.
```sh

 http://<<EC2-PublicIP>>:8080/

```

**Docker**
 is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. It enables efficient deployment, scaling, and management of applications in different environments.

```sh
vi docker.sh

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   #my case is ubuntu
newgrp docker
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

```
**SonarQube**
 is a continuous code quality and security analysis tool that detects bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in source code. It integrates with CI/CD pipelines and supports multiple programming languages.

- After installing Docker, deploy a SonarQube container (ensure port 9000 is open in the security group).

```sh
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community

```

**Trivy** 
 is an open-source vulnerability scanner for containers, file systems, and code repositories. It detects vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposed secrets. It is widely used in DevOps pipelines for security compliance.

```sh
vi trivy.sh

sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release -y
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trivy.gpg] https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy -y

```

### **Step 3 — Obtain the TMDB API Key **

To integrate with The Movie Database (TMDB) and access movie-related data, you need an API key. The TMDB API allows developers to fetch movie details, ratings, images, and more for applications. Follow the steps below to generate your API key:

- Use a VPN (For Users in India) – Since TMDB is currently inaccessible in India, enable a VPN and connect to a different region where the website is available.
- Visit the TMDB Website – Open a web browser and navigate to TMDB (The Movie Database).
- Sign In or Register – Click on "Login" and sign in to your account. If you don’t have one, create a new account.
- Access API Settings – Once logged in, go to your profile settings by clicking on your profile icon and selecting “Settings.”
- Generate an API Key – In the left-side menu, click on “API” and choose the option to create a new API key.
- Accept Terms & Provide Details – Agree to the terms and conditions, fill in the required details, and submit your request.
- Retrieve Your API Key – Once approved, your unique API key will be generated and displayed.

Why is the TMDB API Key Needed?
- The API key acts as an authentication mechanism that allows your application to access TMDB’s vast database of movies, TV shows, and related metadata. It enables fetching movie details, searching for films, displaying posters, and integrating movie-related content into your project.




### **Step 2 — CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**
- Install required Jenkins plugins:  
  - **JDK**, **SonarQube Scanner**, **NodeJS**, **OWASP Dependency Check**
- Configure a **Declarative Pipeline** in Jenkins.
- Integrate Jenkins with GitHub.

### **Step 3 — Docker & Kubernetes Deployment**
- Build a **Docker Image** for the Netflix Clone.
- Push the image to **DockerHub**.
- Deploy the image using Docker.
- Set up **Kubernetes Master & Worker nodes** on Ubuntu 20.04.
- Deploy the application using **K8s manifests**.

### **Step 4 — Monitoring & Logging**
- Install **Prometheus & Grafana** on a monitoring server.
- Install **Prometheus Plugin** in Jenkins.
- Set up **Grafana dashboards** to monitor Jenkins & Kubernetes.

### **Step 5 — Notifications & Cleanup**
- Configure **Email Integration** in Jenkins.
- Automate EC2 **termination** after the project completion.

## 🔹 SecOps Section
### **Step 6 — Security Scanning & Code Quality**
- Install and configure **SonarQube** (Docker Container).
- Perform **static code analysis** on the Netflix Clone repository.

### **Step 7 — Vulnerability Scanning**
- Install **Trivy** for container security scanning.
- Scan the Docker images before deployment.

### **Step 8 — Dependency Scanning**
- Install **OWASP Dependency Check** Plugin in Jenkins.
- Scan project dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
